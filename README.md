# Wings of the Points

This is a chart to visually represent the transfer partnerships between rewards programs of US credit cards and airlines. The resulting webpage is [https://siriolabs.github.io/Wings-of-the-Points/index.html](https://siriolabs.github.io/Wings-of-the-Points/index.html)

Move your mouse over the point name or airline name to highlight transfer relationships. The airlines are grouped by alliances. You can use ctrl+F (or cmd+F) to quickly find an airline.

The transfer ratio of SPG has already considered the 5,000 bonus Starpoints for every 20,000 you transfer at a time. The transfer ratio of Marriott is from the formula for Marriott Rewards Travel Packages: (required number of Marriott points) = 6 * (number of Marriott points for the corresponding category hotel stay per night) + (number of airline miles) * (transfer ratio).
