## Usage
Move your mouse over the point name or airline name to highlight transfer relationships. 
Move your mouse over any line connecting a point and a mile to see the transfer ratio. 
The airlines are grouped by alliances. 
You can use ctrl+F (or cmd+F) to quickly find an airline.

## Note

### SPG
The transfer ratio of SPG has already considered the 5,000 bonus Starpoints for every 20,000 you transfer at a time. 

### Marriott
The transfer ratio of Marriott is from the formula for Marriott Rewards Travel Packages: 
```
(required number of Marriott points) = 6 * (number of Marriott points for the corresponding category hotel stay per night) + (number of airline miles) * (transfer ratio)
```
